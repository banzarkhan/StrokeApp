# StrokeApp
WWDC Swift Student Challenge 2023

## About the project
This is a project created for the Swift Student Challenge. The app is designed to help people recognize the symptoms of a stroke and contact emergency services as quickly as possible. It uses advanced technology to detect two of the three most common symptoms of a stroke - facial paralysis and speech weakness - and prompts the user to send a pre-written message to Emergency Services.

## Usage

To use the app, follow these steps:

* Open the app on your device.
* Follow the setup instructions to allow the app to access your microphone and camera.
* Hold the phone in front of your face and follow the on-screen instructions to detect facial paralysis.
* Speak into the microphone to test speech weakness detection.
* If the app detects one or both symptoms, it will prompt you to send a pre-written message to Emergency Services.
* If you choose to send the message, the app will automatically populate the template message with informayion about you having a stroke.

Note: If you are in a noisy environment, the app may not be able to accurately detect speech weakness. In this case, use the template message to contact emergency services.
